Description: Development files for libsccp, libmtp and libxua
 SCCP is a network layer protocol that provides extended routing, flow control,
 segmentation, connection-orientation, and error correction facilities in
 Signaling System 7 telecommunications networks.
 It is heavily used in cellular networks such as GSM.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.

Description: Osmocom SIGTRAN STP (Signaling Transfer Point)
  This is the Osmocom (Open Source Mobile Communications) implementation
  of a Signaling Transfer Point (STP) for SS7/SIGTRAN telecommunication
