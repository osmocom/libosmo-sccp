This example code is handy in illustrating libosmo-sigtran library use as well as experimenting with SCCP protocol.

Run it as follows:
Server:
./sccp_demo_user -d DLINP,5:DLSS7,5:DLSCCP,1:DSCCP,1:DMAIN,1
Client:
./sccp_demo_user -d DLINP,5:DLSS7,5:DLSCCP,1:DSCCP,1:DMAIN,1 -c
Server's vty:
telnet 127.0.0.1 2324
Client's vty:
telnet 127.0.0.2 2325

On the client side, after entering privileged mode by typing 'enable', you can switch to demo user mode with 'sccp-user' command.

This gives several additional commands, for example:
'called-addr-ssn 202' - selecting "echo" application (201 is "refuser", 203 is "callback")
'connect-req 10 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' - sending N-CONNECT message with ID=12 and optional data

See vty's help for further details.

Calling 'show cs7 instance 0 sccp connections' in privileged mode on the server will show currently active SCCP connections.
